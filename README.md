# Bachelor
Files and scripts for my bachelor's thesis.

This is the code I have written to calculate theta and delta on a three dimensional k-grid (gridmaker), as well as the mode-coupling integrals (i-calculator). It is provided as .py python files and as Jupyter notebooks.

Other than a standard Python installation with common packages, such as Anaconda, the CLASS code is required, available at class-code.net. Additionally, the two modules written by me, FF2 and myfuncs are required. Everything is written in Python 2.7.13.
